                <h1> Welcome to Knowledge Gap!</h1>
                <p>Kowledge Gap is a tool to classify your notes automatically, find new connections between existing ideas and see a mind-map of everything you've learnt. It was made as part of the 2024 UQCS Hackathon, and what you're seeing is a live demo with Isaac Beh's notes. You can find more about Knowledge Gap <a href="https://github.com/49Indium/Knowledge-Gap">here</a>.<p>
                <p>Some things to try:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hover over nodes to see the concepts they represent</li>
                    <li>See automatically generated connections between concepts via the edges of the graph</li>
                    <li>Move nodes around by dragging</li>
                    <li>Move the graph around by dragging with the middle mouse button</li>
                    <li>Create new edges or delete exising ones by clicking between nodes</li>
                    <li>Change the forces (bottom left) and see how the graph responds</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
