## Set-up Guide
This project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) to manage dependancies. You can install it [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/). Once the project is cloned, you can use `poetry install` to get all the needed packages. You can then use `poetry run python <script_name>` to run a file.
